## ðŸ”¶ About Me

I am a cyber security enthuasist with a passion for security, be it IT, Ethical Hacking, threat analysis, or System Security, there's always something new to learn and that fascinates me. At the start of 2024, I dived into Capture the Flag challenges on TryHackMe, instantly captivated by the world of Red Teaming. This passion fueled my pursuit of top-tier certifications where I could test my skillsâ€”culminating in achieving both the eJPT and OSCP! I am now focusing my efforts on looking at the other side of the coin which is Blue Teaming, where I have dedicated my free time into studying the process behind identifying and detecting cyber attacks. I am passionate about keeping systems secure while constantly learning about new found cyber attacks in this field!

## ðŸ”¶ Projects

### Threat Intelligence Lab
This lab was created to hone my skills in being a security analyst. Up until this point, I was mainly solving CTF challenges and looking at one side of the coin. This project led me to gaining a deeper understanding of the workings of  network protocols and how a system can be infiltrated in several ways over the internet. It is a great stepping stone for transtioning into becoming a SOC analyst!

### Guilded YouTube Live Notifier for Unlisted Streams
This was something new for me, I recently started using Guilded, the communication platform for messaging your friends, and I noticed that the platform had webhooks included in its features when creating a server. I also like to stream on Youtube whenever I play games with my friends, so this project revolved around me creating a python script which sent a notification  on my Guilded server notifying members that I was currently live, the notification consisted of a custom message along with a link to the stream. 

The reason this project was interesting was due to the circumstance in which the stream went live, I listed my streams as unlisted which meant only people with links to the stream could see them. Hence I needed to dig deeper and find a better solution for extracting the correct link to the live stream. Utilizing Google's API along with scraping the right weblink  proved to be challenging yet rewarding!

- Find out more over here where there are instructions along with the source code for the python script [Click me](https://github.com/Calwy/unlisted-stream-sender)

## ðŸ”¶ Experience

### Security Analyst Intern
*Dates: September 2022 - April 2023*

This role allowed me to use various industry level tools that helped me gauge the severity of vulnerabilites while also helping me understand the intricacies and precautionary measures that take place before a webiste is deployed
-  **Nessus**: This tool was used to run weekly vulnerability scans on servers that were housing staging websites. These staging websites were used to test new features before deployment to ensure there was no unstability when the site goes live.
-  **Qualys**: This tool was also used to run pre-made scans on a set number of network systems in the corporate network to detect any anomalies which may arise
-  Upon successfull completion of said scans, Reports were compiled and then sent to the respective parties to determine the steps that needed to be taken from then on

### System Administrator | My Homelab
*Dates: March 2024 - Present*

I intially began my journey as a Security Professional by first administrating my own home network. This consisted of two main devices, one acting as the main server which houses open source software and the other which acted as a NAS

Within the main server, I deployed several applications such as:

-  **Wazuh**: Configured a security platform that utilizes protection for endpoints on local devices, ensuring real-time threat detection 
-  **Pi-Hole**: Deployed a network-wide ad blocker for DNS-level filtering  
-  **Portainer**: Set up an efficient container management solution for updating and maintaining docker containers 
-  **NextCloud**: Set up network wide collaboration tool to maintain synchronization across devices 

And on the server running the NAS I deployed:
-  **TrueNAS**: Set up on demand, reliable file server for centralized storage and data management between local network devices
